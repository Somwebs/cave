Cave CSS is a simple classless CSS to start your project with a great looking HTML. It's minimal, clean, and helps you start with confidence.

## Instalation
Assuming you already have [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) set up, just run the following. <br>
`npm i cave-css`

<br>
OR
<br>
If you want to test things out, copy and past the following inside your html `head` tag. <br>

`
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://cdn.cave.somwebs.com/cave/cave.css">
`
*Paste the CDN link above your main CSS file link to make sure Cave doesn't override your code.*

Thats it. Just start writing your html and Cave will do it's thing.
