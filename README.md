## Getting Started

Getting started is easy, you can use Cave via CDN or download the source code for more advanced projects. 

```css
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://cdn.cave.somwebs.com/cave/cave.css">
```
*Paste the CDN link above your main CSS file to make sure Cave doesn't override your code.*
