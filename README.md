Cave CSS is a simple classless CSS to start your project with a great looking HTML. It's minimal, clean, and helps you start with confidence.

## Instalation
Assuming you already have [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) set up, just run the following. <br>
`npm i cave-css`
 (This includes the SASS files.)
<br>
OR
<br>
You can just grap the generated file of the latest version [here](https://cdn.cave.somwebs.com/cave/cave.css).

Thats it! 😁
